                       CCNx Link Local Resources
                draft-wood-icnrg-ccnxlinklocalresources

Abstract

   A CCNx link local name is one that only has meaning for a link
   between two CCNx forwarders.  These names can be used (in Interests)
   to get and set link local resources about a link.  A resource is a
   piece of information such as the link MTU that is influences the
   behavior of the link used by two or more peers.  This document
   describes how the type and format of link-local names and how they
   are used to manipulate link local resources.

1.  Introduction

   CCNx link local names are CCNx names given to Interest and Content
   Objects that transfer resource information and perform resource
   operations between two peers over a single link.  A link can be both
   point-to-point and multicast.  Thus, at a minimum, a link local name
   must contain:

   1.  The name of the target resource.

   2.  The operation to be perform on a given resource.

   3.  A unique identifier of the sender of an Interest with a link
       local name.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Peer: A CCNx forwarder.

   Link: A connection between two peers.

   Heartbeat: A keep-alive message that is sent between two peers to
   maintain the link.

2.  Link Local Name Format

   The format of a link local name is given below.

   lci:/local/link/<identifier>/<operation>/<resource>

3.  Link Local Resources

   The following set of resources are available for any link:

   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Resource Name        | Resource Description                       |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | LINK                 | The local link                             |
   |                      |                                            |
   | MTU                  | The link MTU                               |
   |                      |                                            |
   | FragmentationStart   | The starting fragmentation number          |
   |                      |                                            |
   | FragmentationSeqSize | The size of the sequence number field in a |
   |                      | CCNx message                               |
   |                      |                                            |
   | Heartbeat            | A heartbeat message                        |
   |                      |                                            |
   | HeartbeatFrequency   | The frequency at which heartbeat messages  |
   |                      | are sent (in seconds)                      |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+

4.  Link Local Resource Operations

   The following resource operations can be performed by clients
   (consumers).

   o  GET: Retrieve the (set of) values for the target resource.

   o  SET: Make a selection from a set of resource values.

   o  DELETE: Delete a given resource.  Some resources are artificial
      and cannot be deleted (e.g., Compression algorithm), whereas
      others are real and can be deleted (e.g., Links).

5.  Sender Identifiers

   The sender of an Interest with a link local name must include an
   unique identifier.  This identifier is a random 32-bit nonce
   generated by the consumer when the link is created.  For 1-n
   multicast links (e.g., WiFi), a forwarder must take care to guarantee
   uniqueness among client (sender) identifiers.

6.  Security Considerations

   All link local operations (e.g., GET, SET, DELETE) must only be
   performed if the sending party is trusted.  Link local operations
   will not be performed upon request from untrusted and unauthenticated
   clients.
